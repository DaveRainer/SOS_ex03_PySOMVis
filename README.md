# TU Wien SOS Exercise 3

This repo is a fork of the PYSOMVis github project for the purpose of implementing the assignment 3 task of the Self Organizing Systems course 2023 at TU Vienna.

The repository is identical to the original project at forking time, with the only difference being the implementation of the assignment in `PySOMVis/coding_assignment.ipynb`.
